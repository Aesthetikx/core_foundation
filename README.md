# CoreFoundation

This is an FFI wrapper around a subset of CoreFoundation. Currently, only UUID is implemented.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

## Usage

### UUID

```ruby
allocator = nil

sixteen_bytes = [
  0x00, 0x11, 0x22, 0x33,
  0x44, 0x55, 0x66, 0x77,
  0x88, 0x99, 0xAA, 0xBB,
  0xCC, 0xDD, 0xEE, 0xFF
]

uuid_ref = CoreFoundation::CFUUIDCreateWithBytes(allocator, *sixteen_bytes)

cf_uuid_bytes = CoreFoundation::CFUUIDGetUUIDBytes(uuid_ref)

cf_uuid_bytes[:byte15] # => 0xFF
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
